is every permission Rin asks for, and what commands you lose if you
don't grant that permission.

## Filling Out The .env File

Getting _all_ the API keys for your `.env` file can be a pain on a
bot this big, I know. That's why I've compiled a list here of where
to go to get _every single API key_. Note, not all of these are free.

### Discord-related Info

* `RIN_TOKEN` can be obtained at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
* `OWNERS` is a comma-seperated list of Discord User IDs.
* `LOVER_USER_ID` is a Discord User ID for your lover. It rigs commands like `coolness` and `cuteness`. Totally optional, loners can leave it out.
* `RIN_PREFIX` is the prefix you want the bot to have. Like `x;`.
* `INVITE` is an invite link to a Discord server. The whole thing, not just the code.
* `RIN_WEBHOOK_ID` is the ID of the webhook you want the `webhook` command to use.
* `RIN_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` is the token of the webhook you want the `webhook` command to use.
* `REPORT_CHANNEL_ID` is the ID of the Discord channel you want to send messages from `report` to. Not required, and if not provided the report command simply DMs the owner.
* `JOIN_LEAVE_CHANNEL_ID` is the ID of the Discord channel to send a message to whenever a new server adds or removes the bot. Not required.

### Emoji IDs

All the emoji IDs are the IDs of Discord custom emoji. You need to
make these yourself, but none are required, and any left out will
simply switch to basic text.

### API Keys, IDs, and Secrets

Here's where things get LONG. If you're greeted with a log-in page
when clicking any of these links, you'll need an account for that
API. All are free unless otherwise stated.

* `ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY` can be obtained at the [Alpha Vantage website](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).
* `BITLY_KEY` can be obtained by getting a [Generic Access Token](https://bitly.is/accesstoken).
* `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` can be obtained by [creating an access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
* `GOOGLE_KEY` can be obtained at the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). Be sure to click "Enable APIs and Services" and enable the following APIs:
	- [YouTube Data API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com)
	- [Safe Browsing API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/safebrowsing.googleapis.com)
* `GOV_KEY` can be obtained at the [NASA Open APIs portal](https://api.nasa.gov/).
* `OPENWEATHERMAP_KEY` can be obtained at the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/price). Click "Get API Key" on the plan you want (probably Free).
* `OSU_KEY` can be obtained by [signing up at the osu! API page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api/). Whether this link takes you to the right page or not is hit-or-miss.
* `THECATAPI_KEY` can be obtained at the [TheCatAPI website](https://thecatapi.com/).
* `TMDB_KEY` can be obtained by [following these instructions at the TMDB website](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Read the "How do I apply for an API key?" section.
* `WEBSTER_KEY` can be obtained by [going to the Dictionary API website](https://dictionaryapi.com/). Find the "GET STARTED USING OUR API" section.
* `RIN_GITHUB_REPO_NAME` and `RIN_GITHUB_REPO_USERNAME` are just the username and name of Rin's repo on GitHub. For example, `fruitykitkats` for the username and `rin` for the name.

### Imgur Album IDs

This section is a bit different, as all of these keys are the same
process. First, [sign up for Imgur](https://imgur.com/). Then, just
go to your profile and make albums that contain the images for the
command you want to use. Use the ID of that album (look at the URL)
as the variable. Yes, you need to fill these albums yourself.
